		<img class="modal-img" src="images/CSSearch-Result.png" alt="Finished Product">

		<p>CS Search is a redesigned interface for the Steam Community Market that reduces clicks, improves search efficiency, and highlights commonly used features.</p>

		<section id="problem">
			<h3>The Problem</h3>
			<p>Steam’s Community Market for CS2 feels outdated compared to modern third-party marketplaces. Its search menu requires significantly more keystrokes and clicks to complete the same tasks, creating friction and slowing users down. This inefficiency makes performing frequent searches unnecessarily difficult for power users, often driving them to alternative marketplaces.</p>
			<p>To better understand these pain points, active CS2 investors and traders were surveyed. Their feedback highlighted frustrations with the current search interface and emphasized a need for streamlined access to commonly used features, such as search autofill, advanced sticker search for applied stickers, and applied charm search.</p>
		</section>

		<section id="design-goals">
			<h3>Design Goals</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Reduce the number of clicks and keystrokes for frequent searches</li>
				<li>Showcase commonly used features while keeping the interface familiar</li>
				<li>Maintain visual consistency with the current Steam Community Market design</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section id="wireframes">
			<h3>Wireframes</h3>
			<img class="modal-img" src="images/CSSearch-WireFrame.png" alt="Wireframe">
			<p>Initial wireframes outlining the redesigned menu structure and key user flows. The design emphasizes accessibility, streamlined navigation, and intuitive placement of common features.</p>
		</section>

		<section id="implementation">
			<h3>Implementation</h3>
			<img class="modal-img" src="images/CSSearch-Homepage.png" alt="Implementation Screenshot">
			<p>The redesigned menu was built using HTML and JavaScript, styled to match the Steam Community Market’s existing color palette and menu patterns for a seamless look. Subtle accent colors inspired by CS2 were added to help users quickly distinguish common elements. The new menu remains accessible at all times, offering instant search with autofill, as well as direct support for applied sticker and charm searches.</p>
		</section>

		<section id="results">
			<h3>Results</h3>
			<h4>Efficiency Improvements</h4>
			<img class="modal-img" src="images/CSSearch-Graph.png" alt="Efficiency Graph">
            <p>The SCM required 16 total interactions (7 clicks, 9 keystrokes), while CS Search reduced this to 10 total interactions (4 clicks, 6 keystrokes) — a 37.5% overall reduction*. This demonstrates a significant efficiency improvement for frequent searches.</p>
			<p class="footnote">*Search for AK-47 Redline, FT, MW, Normal</p>
		</section>

		<section id="conclusion">
			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			<p>Through research, design, and development, the new search menu transforms the Steam Community Market into a more efficient tool. With fewer interactions required, it removes friction from frequent searches and creates a smoother, more productive user experience.</p>
