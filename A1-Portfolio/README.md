Firstly this is a semi-resued portfolio website I built this previous summer. I needed to add 1 advanced feature but I also wanted to go through and clean up the code to better learn html/css and improve the design of my website evanstewart.net.

1. The number of assignment points you believe you have completed
I belive I have met every requirement fully so a 10/10. I put in everything that I think makes a nice portfolio website into this and spent significant time on tiny details that make the site come togehter even if its not in the rubric like transitions, hover details, adding a modal for images, ect.

2. A list containing the basic HTML content, CSS styling, and advanced feature you included in your portfolio

Basic (3 minimum, I did 5):
- Multiple Images with descriptive alt attributes
- appropriate headings and paragraph text
- Links to external pages
- Sematic HTML tags like footer (i also did header)
- Used a google custom icon (resume page)

CSS Styling (2 minimumI did 2),:
- Modifying padding and margins to indent content and enhance readability
- modifying link, text color, and other colors to be visually appealing

Advanced Feature(1 minimum, I did 1):
-Create a much complex page layout
    This was done through creating a navigation sidebar. I also went the extra step and created a hamburger button for smaller screen sizes so that way it can be opened when the user wants to see the menu but not all the time.

3. Rationale for any accessibility errors you ignored

There were no full errors I ignored.

The only potenital errors i ingored were on achecker. These were mostly for accesiblity like not long enough alt text ect. Some were for things that were not correct like it said i may be using the wrong color which i was not. 

4. How long it took you to complete the assignment
So i am resuing a portfolio, i designed the portolio over summer and put a lot of time into it as i needed to learn html/css from scratch.

I spent roughly 30 hours over the course of a week making it. Although a good 10 hours of that was on the content and hosting so not coding.

In this class I spent about 15 hours reimplementing it and cleaning up the code, making a nicer color pallet for the website, filling out the aboutme, adding an advanced feature(sidebar/navbar), and adding more small details to make it stand out.

5. A list of urls of the online resources you consulted

https://www.w3schools.com/

I used it for both a guide for html, css, and javascript. I did my best to reformat my messy code into cleaner code referencing their guides. I also used it to learn how to use a modal and implement it.

I used it to learn how to style nav bar and the different options for that

As stated in the syllabus we are allowed to use it as long as its for ideas/implementation. I wanted to make my website very good so i asked it a lot of questoins regarding options. I also used it a lot to find what articles on w3school to read. If it gave me a few suggestoins i could then go look them up and see how to implement them.

Some prompt examples would be (i included responses for ones i remember some of these i thought of from months ago):
- I have my base website built and want to know how i can make it formated for mobile
- How do i add a footer/header(this was before this class over summer so i had no idea that that was even a thing)
- So i have images but i want to make them clickable and have them expand how can i do that?
- Why is my program having x bug (i had problem implementing the page tabs at first and did this over summer pre this class). 
-is this line xxxx the corect formating for me to do xxxx (one example would be is x line formatted properly for me to redirect form contact back to index).
Response: yes this is correct formating
-How to detach an aside within a container that also contains a main so just main is centered. 
Response: To do this you would want both to be in a conatainer that takes up the whole page and then can position the two sections within that container
-Im struggling to get my nav bar ceneterd. Since vh changes so much i cant use that. What are some possible techniques that might be helpful for cenetering items in the middle of a page?
Response: there is a technique which you use top50% to bring the item down 50% and then use transform: translateY(-50%) to bring it up 50% of the items vh making it cenetered.
-how do i increaes the clickable area on my nav bar
Response: You can use display: inline-block and add padding in order to make the padding clickable expandnig the footprint of the clickable area
-how can i use that 3 line button that could allow me to open a menu i want hidden on mobile
Response: In @media you can use a checkbox html and hamburger styling in order to create a button that can open a menu
-how can i hide a sidebar menu when my checkbox is not checked
Response: Just toggle off display when you dont want it seen
