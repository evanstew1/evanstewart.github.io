        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am passionate about designing interfaces that are intuitive and easy to use. My interest in software engineering stems from wanting the ability to improve and redesign products that frustrate me. This desire inspired me to build my Chrome Extension CSSearch not only for myself but for others in the community to enjoy. I love optimizing websites and apps because I know how much a poor interface can drive away users. I find it rewarding to make a seamless digital experience with accessibility at the forefront. I often encounter sites that don't scale well when zoomed in, leading to eye strain. I enjoy solving problems that make technology more user friendly and inclusive.
