				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>UCI Anteater Atlas was a quarter-long project where we identified a campus-wide problem and designed a digital solution to address it. My team created Anteater Atlas, a centralized resource platform for UCI students designed to simplify access to academic, research, and mental health resources through a clean, user-friendly interface. Throughout the process, we created User Flows, Wireframes, Mockups, and a Figma Protype. Then all of this was displayed on my team's project website.</p>

				<h3>My Role</h3>
				<div class="bullet-container">
					<p>• <strong>Coordinated the team</strong> by scheduling group meetings and structuring the workflow</p>
					<p>• <strong>Synthesized research insights</strong> by compiling user interviews and identifying key themes</p>
					<p>• <strong>Set design priorities</strong> by determining the key features of the platform</p>
					<p>• <strong>Created Task and User Flows</strong> from interview insights</p>
					<p>• <strong>Contributed to the High Fidelity Designs</strong> in Figma and ensured visual consistency</p>

				<h3>Task and User Flows</h3>
				<div class="image-container">
					<img class="modal-img" src="images/UCIAAFlows1.png" alt="Task and User Flows">
				</div>
				<p>I created the task and user flows to demonstrate how users might interact with Anteater Atlas. These flows highlighted common use patterns that would help us guide our design decisions. Making sure we had all the appropriate pages and error prevention/backtracking options for seamless navigation. These task and user flows ensured that the team could create an intuitive experience for users.</p>

				<h3>Key Insights</h3>
				<div class="image-container">

				</div>
				<p>
 To uncover the primary pain points of the student experience, I conducted some of the teams one-on-one user interviews and performed a qualitative analysis of the interview data collected by my teammates. By synthesizing these notes, I identified recurring themes in student behavior and preferences, which allowed me to narrow our focus to four key insights. To ensure our design was grounded in real-world needs, I extracted direct quotes from the participants to validate our findings and guide our feature prioritization.				</p>

			<section id="prototype">
				<h3>High Fidelity Prototype</h3>
				<div class="image-container">
					<img class="modal-img" src="images/UCIAA-ToolsAndPortals.png" alt="High Fidelity Prototype">
				</div>
				<p class="footnote"><sup>*</sup>Example of the resouce page designed for mobile.</p>
				<p>I contributed to several core pages of the high-fidelity mockup, focusing on maintaining visual consistency across the platform. My work involved translating our established style guide and component library into functional layouts, ensuring that typography and spacing remained uniform with the sections designed by my teammates. I focused on optimizing the information hierarchy of the resource modules, making sure that the most vital information was accessible at a glance without cluttering the mobile view.</p>

			<section id="outcome">
				<h3>Outcome</h3>
				<p>By the end of the quarter, we delivered both a high-fidelity and interactive prototype that centralized UCI’s academic resources into one hub. A platform that was easy to navigate and allowed the user to easily find what resources they were looking for without scouring across many webpages.</p>
